aionationstates
===============

A python3.6.1+ asynchronous wrapper for the NationStates Web interface & API.

**Features:**

- Doesn't fall apart in your hands
- Sane interface that generally doesn't tend to contradict itself
- Implements pretty much the entire Nation, Region, and World APIs
- Including a convenient happenings interface
- Oh, did I mention the Private Nation API?
- Yep, that's implemented too
- The World Assembly API will be added soon I promise
- Ratelimiting is handled internally
- Like a whole bunch of things are handled internally
- You are free to forget they ever existed in the first place
- Not all things though sadly
