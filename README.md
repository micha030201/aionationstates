# aionationstates

aionationstates is an asyncio & aiohttp wrapper for the [NationStates](https://www.nationstates.net/) API and web interface. 

The goal of the project is to provide all the necessary tools for automated nation control, as well as convenient ways to interface Nation, Region, World, WA, and Verification APIs.

## Developement stage

This project is early in its alpha stage. As such, a lot of features are either not implemented at all, or implemented extremely poorly. Documentation is missing completely, and so are tests.

Yeah, you should really just wait until I get this lib into a usable state. Don't bother with it right now. More trouble than it's worth.

## Depends on

* [Python 3.6+](https://python.org/)
* [aiohttp](https://aiohttp.readthedocs.io/)
